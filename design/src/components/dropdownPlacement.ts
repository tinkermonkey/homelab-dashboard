 *
 *  bottom-start (default) → panel hangs below, left edge aligned with trigger
 *  bottom-end             → panel hangs below, right edge aligned with trigger
 *  top-start              → panel rises above, left edge aligned with trigger
 *  top-end                → panel rises above, right edge aligned with trigger
